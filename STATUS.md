## Current state

v0.3 is done: the ledger can be trusted, and audited, by someone who does
not trust whoever holds it. An `Intent` flows through `Admission`
(per-agent token bucket + bounded priority queue with backpressure) into
the scheduler, which starts only what may run now: a `Global` change
alone, `Region` changes one at a time with their resource to themselves,
and narrow changes in parallel across resources up to a per-resource
in-flight limit. Each intent that can start is ruled on by the
deny-overrides policy `Gate` plus a conflict check against other agents'
recent changes to the same resource. Admitted intents are in flight until
the caller reports back; deferred intents wait in a hold queue for a human
to release or expire them.

Every decision, release, expiry and outcome lands in a SHA-256 hash-chained
`Ledger`. With a keyring, agents sign their intents with Ed25519 and every
record carries its agent's signature. The ledger cuts Merkle checkpoints
(RFC 6962) that the plane can sign, so an auditor can check what came after
a trusted checkpoint without replaying from genesis, or prove a single
record with a logarithmic inclusion proof. The whole ledger, or the part
after a checkpoint, exports as JSON Lines, and an independent verifier
using only Node's standard library (`tools/verify-ledger.mjs`) checks every
digest, link, Merkle root and signature, and that every record shows the
intent its agent signed, in CI.

Still zero dependencies (SHA-256, SHA-512 and Ed25519 are from scratch)
and pinned to Rust 1.95. 173 unit tests, 9 doctests (including the README
examples), a randomized invariant test (300 seeded floods plus 6 signed
ones, each ending in checkpoint audits), an edge-case export fixture, and
16 tamper tests of the independent verifier; fmt + clippy (`-D warnings`)
clean.

The floodwall.ai site (React + Vite in `site/`, built into `docs/` for
GitHub Pages) describes the scheduler and hold queue.

## Recently shipped

- **v0.3** - FW-301 to FW-304: SHA-256 hash chain, Ed25519-signed intents
  and records, signed Merkle checkpoints with suffix audits and inclusion
  proofs, and a JSON Lines export with an independent verifier.
- **v0.2** - FW-201 to FW-207: scheduler stage and in-flight tracking,
  wide-blast serialization, per-resource lanes, conflict detection,
  per-resource in-flight limits, hold queue with human release and
  expiry, and the demo, README and site updates.
- **v0.1.x** - FW-101 to FW-106: robots.txt and sitemap.xml shipped, CI
  check that `docs/` matches `site/`, `RateLimit` validation, refilled
  rate-limit buckets forgotten, ledger evidence, and site stats read from
  the crate.
- **v0.1** - Intent model, admission control, policy gate, hash-chained
  ledger, end-to-end `Floodwall`, demo binary, CI, Dependabot.

## Next up

- **v0.4 persistence + replay** - FW-401 to FW-405: a durable ledger on
  disk (the JSON Lines export is a natural starting format, but reading it
  back needs a JSON parser the crate does not have yet), the tick on every
  record (FW-404), and rebuilding admission, scheduler and hold state from
  the ledger (FW-402, FW-405).

## Known gaps

- A retired agent key (kept for audits after a rotation) verifies any of
  its agent's records, because records do not yet carry the time they were
  written (FW-404).

- An intent the caller never completes holds its place forever (FW-906).
- The `by` in a release or expiry is free text, not a verified identity
  (FW-907).
- Priority is strict, so `Bulk` work can starve under a constant stream of
  higher-priority intents (FW-908).
- The plane's verdicts are protected once a checkpoint covering them is
  signed (`Ledger::with_signer`). Records after the latest signed
  checkpoint can still be rewritten by whoever holds the ledger until the
  next one is cut, so pick the checkpoint interval with that window in
  mind, or cut one with `Floodwall::checkpoint` when it matters.
- Ed25519 signing is from scratch and not side-channel audited; agents
  holding long-lived production keys may prefer to sign with a vetted
  library (the signatures verify here all the same).
